# DICE GAME

A two-player game, in which the player can keep throwing dice until he/she draws one or decide to hold, then it's the other player's turn. In the case of one being drawn, the dice rolls score from that turn is not added to the player score. That's why the player needs to decide when to hold the score wisely. A player wins when he/she reaches a score of 100 first.
